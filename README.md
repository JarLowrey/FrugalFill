## Frugal Fill

This project was designed to integrate Google Maps API and a gas station pricing API to make it easy to find the best fill up station along your route.
Unfortunately it seems the only viable gas pricing API is [OPIS](http://www.opisnet.com/), which costs 45k/yr and is thus beyond my budget.
There's some cool Google maps integration stuff here tho, might come back to it one day if pricing lowers.
